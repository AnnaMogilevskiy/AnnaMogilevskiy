### HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Anna, a Data Analyst.


I finished TripleTen Israel. It was an interesting journey with 12 real data-based projects. My skills include Python, SQL, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, A/B Testing, Machine Learning, Business Analytics.

Currently I keep practicing my new skills.

I love to research, to get new knowledge and to solve interesting tasks.
